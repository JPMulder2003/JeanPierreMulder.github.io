								<h2>Python</h2>
								<p>Finally got to a subject a have much interest in. Everything up to this point has been tough, and extremely enjoyable.</p>
								<p>Covering week 6, I only included some code from the one problem set done. this is to honour the CS50

										<h2 class="major">Week 6 - Python</h2>
										<p>The lesson included Python Syntax and the comparable in C. I was introduced to libraries and their uses and why you should use them. We were also provided the documentation to read through if and when you do get stuck.
											Overall the hand holding started to get way less, but by this this time I was comfortable enough to go and search for the answers... another valuable skill the course teaches you.
										</p>
										<p><u>The following problems where included:</u></p>
										<ul>
											<li>World Cup - Write a program to run simulations of the FIFA World Cup.</li>
											<li>Hello - Create a program in Python that greets the user with "Hello, user name"</li>
											<li>Mario-Less - Implement a program in Python that draws a pyramid</li>
											<li>Mario-More - Implement a program in Python that draws a left & right facing pyramid, with two spaces in between</li>
											<li>Cash - Implement a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made</li>
											<li>Credit - Implement a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number</li>
											<li>Readability - Implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text</li>
											<li>DNA - Implement a program that identifies a person based on their DNA</li>
										</ul>
										<blockquote>
											I enjoyed all of the problems, especially to see how much less code is written in Python compared to C. The mario-more problem, 
											for example, I used a single line of code to print the entirety of the two pyramids. I included the Credit problem again to compare the differences.
										</blockquote>
										<h4>The snippet does the same as in the C version of Credit, this time it is just much less code and more readable</h4>
										<pre><code>
# Variable to hold the sum total of the value of all the digits in the card number
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the digits in the card number starting with the second from last and iterating through every second digit
    for digit in card_number[-2::-2]:
        # Cast the current digit to an integer
        digit_value = int(digit)
        # If the digit value multiplied by 2 is more than 9, subtract 9 to emulate adding the two separate digits
        if digit_value * 2 > 9:
            sum += (digit_value * 2) - 9
        else:
            # Else just add the value of the digit times 2 to the sum
            sum += (digit_value * 2)
    # Loop over the digits that has not been added yet
    for digit in card_number[-1::-2]:
        digit_value = int(digit)
        # And add the value to the sum
        sum += digit_value
    # If the last digit from sum modulus 10 is equal to 0, the card is valid
    if sum % 10 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        print("INVALID\n")
