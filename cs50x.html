												I was taught three aspects when evaluating code... correctness, design & style. The week covered IDEs, compilers, interfaces and how various code editors function. 
												Functions, arguments, return values, variables, conditionals and boolean expressions were introduced along with some syntactic sugar. Types, format codes, operators and the different loops.
												all the basics of what makes up a program where taught.
											</p>
											<p><u>The following problems where included:</u></p>
											<ul>
												<li>Hello - Create a program that takes input from user and prints: Hello, (User Input)!</li>
												<li>Mario-Less - Implement a program that draws a pyramid</li>
												<li>Mario-More - Implement a program that draws a left & right facing pyramid, with two spaces in between</li>
												<li>Cash - Implement a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made</li>
												<li>Credit - Implement a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number</li>
											</ul>
											<blockquote>My favorite problem to solve has to be the Credit, due to Luhn's Algorithm that was required. I included a small code snippet.</blockquote>
											<h4>This code checks the length of the card number and determines what type of card is presented</h4>
											<pre><code>
// Check the digit length to determine which card is being used
else if (numDigits == 13 || numDigits == 15 || numDigits == 16)
{

	long firstDigit = getFirstDigit(cardNum);
	long twoDigits = getFirst2Digits(cardNum);

	// Checking for VISA
	if (firstDigit == 4)
	{
		printf("VISA\n");
	}
	// Checking for Master Card
	else if (twoDigits == 51 || twoDigits == 52 || twoDigits == 53 || twoDigits == 54 || twoDigits == 55)

									<button class="collapsible">Week 2 - Arrays</button>
										<div class="contents"><br>
											<section>
												<p>
													This week consisted of learning to debug code and the various ways to debug code. How much memory, bytes, are used by the different data types like chars, strings, boolean, ints, float. I was also introduced to Command-line arguments.
												</p>

													<li>Caesar - Implement a program that encrypts messages using a Caesar cipher</li>
													<li>Substitution - Implement a program that implements a substitution cipher</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>I preferred the Substitution problem as I know there is a couple places where I could improve the code, like the below snippet</blockquote>
												<h4>The code should check for duplicate letters</h4>
												<pre><code>
// Loop through each character and increment the count, each letter will change the count by 1, if a duplicate has been found the count will be more than 26

									<button class="collapsible">Week 3 - Algorithms</button>
										<div class="contents"><br>
											<section>
												<p>
													Algorithms were covered in this week. A basic intro to them and it is expected of you to teach yourself how to learn more about algorithms. The Big O notation concept was introduced along with linear and binary search.
													Structures was discussed and implemented in the problem sets and a few sorting algorithms were taught. Selection, bubble and merge sort was demonstrated. With merge sort the concept of recursion was also introduced. 
												</p>
												<p><u>The following problems where included:</u></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Sort - Analyze three sorting programs to determine which algorithms they use.</li>
													<li>Plurality - Implement a program that runs a plurality election</li>
													<li>Runoff - Implement a program that runs a runoff election</li>
													<li>Tideman - Implement a program that runs a Tideman election</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>I didn't enjoy any one problem more than the other, rather enjoyed the understanding behind the different algorithms that is required to be implemented. I decided to show the Tideman code snippet</blockquote>
												<h4>The challenge was to sort the pairs that would display the winner of any given pair</h4>
												<pre><code>
// Sort pairs in decreasing order by strength of victory
void sort_pairs(void)
{
	// Loop through the Pairs array and sort in descending order. Pair count used as the length as it holds the total number of pairs available.
	// https://www.javatpoint.com/c-program-to-sort-the-elements-of-an-array-in-ascending-order -- resource used to check selection sort.
	// The trick is to sort the pairs, which are arrays in themselves.
	// First start with a variable to hold the index that is being looped through and a variable to check what the difference is in the victory of the first pair at index i
	for (int i = 0; i < pair_count; i++)
	{
		int index = i;
		int strength = preferences[pairs[i].winner][pairs[i].loser] - preferences[pairs[i].loser][pairs[i].winner];
		// Loop through the pairs at i + 1 (the next pair) and assign it to a temp variable to compare to the initial pair. This loop checks which pair would be the max value
		for (int j = i + 1; j < pair_count; j++)
		{
			int temp_strength = preferences[pairs[j].winner][pairs[j].loser] - preferences[pairs[j].loser][pairs[j].winner];
			// if the strength of victory on the temp pair is more than the strength value, the index changes to value j (the next pair to check) and strength variable is calculated again
			if (temp_strength > strength)
			{
				index = j;
				strength = preferences[pairs[j].winner][pairs[j].loser] - preferences[pairs[j].loser][pairs[j].winner];
			}
		}
		// The pairs array is assigned to have the highest strength of victory and swapped with the lower value so the loop starts at the next index and the highest value is in the correct place.
		pair temp = pairs[index];
		pairs[index] = pairs[i];
		pairs[i] = temp;

									<button class="collapsible">Week 4 - Memory</button>
										<div class="contents">
											<section><br>
												<p>
													I was introduced to the hexadecimal values and how pointers work to point to a variable via the address. The malloc function was also explored along with the issues it can cause if the allocated memory is not freed.
													The week was hectic on the issues of memory allocation but also how C is excellent for low level programming.
												</p>
												<p><u>The following problems where included:</u></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Volume - Write a program to modify the volume of an audio file.</li>
													<li>Filter-less - Create a program that applies grayscale, sepia, reflection & blur filters to BMPs</li>
													<li>Filter-more - Create a program that applies grayscale, reflection, blur & edges filters to BMPs</li>
													<li>Recover - Implement a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													I enjoyed the challange these problems provided and of my favorite I enjoyed working on the Blur filter on both the filter problems.
													For filter-less I had way too many if conditionals, and I realized it can be done better as the snippet from my filter-more code.
												</blockquote>
												<h4>The code loops through a 3x3 box surrounding the pixel that needs to be blurred</h4>
												<pre><code>
// Loop Through a 3x3 box surrounding & including the current pixel at imgCopy[i][j], which would start at -1 at top left and end at bottom right with 1
for (int h = -1; h < 2; h++)
{
	for (int w = -1; w < 2; w++)
	{
		// If pixel is outside from a height(column) stand point, skip

									<button class="collapsible">Week 5 - Data Structures</button>
										<div class="contents"><br>
											<section>
												<p>
													The week included a recap of everything learned up to this point. Linked lists, growing arrays & linked lists were discussed and how this would affect the algorithm, more precisely the Big O.
													I was also introduced to trees and hash tables and where these come into the bigger picture.
												</p>
												<p><u>The following problems where included:</u></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Inheritance - Simulate the inheritance of blood types for each member of a family.</li>
													<li>Speller - Implement a program that spell-checks a file using a hash table</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>The Speller problem was interesting, purely because it forced you to start understanding hash tables and how to implement them.</blockquote>
												<h4>The code snippet shows a function that returns a words hash value to use in the hash table</h4>
												<pre><code>
// Hashes word to a number
unsigned int hash(const char *word)
{
	// I used the following resources to learn more about hash tables and has functions

									<button class="collapsible">Week 6 - Python</button>
										<div class="contents"><br>
											<section>
												<p>
													The lesson included Python Syntax and the comparable in C. I was introduced to libraries and their uses and why you should use them. We were also provided the documentation to read through if and when you do get stuck.
													Overall the hand holding started to get way less, but by this this time I was comfortable enough to go and search for the answers... another valuable skill the course teaches you.
												</p>
												<p><u>The following problems where included:</u></p>
												<ul>
													<li>World Cup - Write a program to run simulations of the FIFA World Cup.</li>
													<li>Hello - Create a program in Python that greets the user with "Hello, user name"</li>
													<li>Mario-Less - Implement a program in Python that draws a pyramid</li>
													<li>Mario-More - Implement a program in Python that draws a left & right facing pyramid, with two spaces in between</li>
													<li>Cash - Implement a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made</li>

													<li>Readability - Implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text</li>
													<li>DNA - Implement a program that identifies a person based on their DNA</li>
												</ul>
												<blockquote>
													I enjoyed all of the problems, especially to see how much less code is written in Python compared to C. The mario-more problem, 
													for example, I used a single line of code to print the entirety of the two pyramids. I included the Credit problem again to compare the differences.
												</blockquote>
												<h4>The snippet does the same as in the C version of Credit, this time it is just much less code and more readable</h4>
