								<h2><a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics" target="_blank">Google Data Analytics</a></h2>
								<p>
									Get started in the in-demand field of data analytics with a Professional Certificate from Google. 
									Learn how to process and analyze data, use key analysis tools, apply R programming, and create visualizations that can inform key business decisions.
								</p>
								<p>
									After completing CS50, I started getting very interested in data and Data analytics. I found the course through various YouTube channels and decided to pay the subscription to complete the course.
								</p>
								
								<button class="collapsible">Course 1 - Foundations</button>
								<div class="contents"><br>
									<section>
										<h2>Foundations: Data, Data Everywhere</h2>
										<p>Data helps us make decisions in everyday life and in business. In this first part of the course, I learn how data analysts use data analytics and the tools of their trade to inform those decisions.</p>
										<p>
											This was the first part of the 8 course certificate and I was excited to start. I got an overview of what data analysts do and the many roles that encompasses this profession.
											I was taught about the steps taken to do an analysis, the data life cycle and what tools are used in data analysis.
										</p>

								<div class="contents"><br>
									<section>
										<h2>Ask Questions to make Data-Driven Decisions</h2>
										<p>
											To do the job of a data analyst, you need to ask questions and problem-solve. In this part of the course, I check out some common analysis challenges and how analysts address them. 
											I also learn about effective questioning techniques that can help guide your analysis.
										</p>
										<p>
											At this point I learned how to solve problems with data, how to use analytics to make data-driven decisions using/asking SMART & effective questions.
											The course also included spreadsheet formulas & functions, and a introduction to dashboard basics with Tableau.
										</p>

								<div class="contents"><br>
									<section>
										<h2>Prepare Data for Exploration</h2>
										<p>
											As a data analyst, you need to be an expert at structuring, extracting, and making sure the data you are working with is reliable. 
											To do this, it is always best to develop a general idea of how all data is generated and collected, since every organization structures data differently. 
											Then, no matter what data structure I am faced with in my new role, I will feel confident working with it.
										</p>
										<p>
											In this course I was taught how data is generated, the features of different data types, fields and values. Data structures (within Data Analytics context) was also discussed and taught
											along with the function of metadata. SQL was the main focus of this course in regards to preparing data.
										</p>

								<div class="contents"><br>

										<h2>Process data from Dirty to Clean</h2>
										<p>
											The focus will be more attention on practical, hands-on assignments and projects. This progressively increases the amount of time you have to develop important job skills.
										</p>
										<p>
											Following on the previous course, the concepts of data integrity and the importance of clean data is discussed and practiced. I learn about the tools & processes used by data analysts to clean
											data and how verification and reports are done. Statistics, hypothesis testing and margin of error are also taught in the course.

								<div class="contents"><br>
									<section>
										<h2>Analyze Data to Answer Questions</h2>
										<p>The goal of data analysis is to make sense out of the data I collect and receive. I will organize and format data. This will help me think about data in different ways.</p>
										<p>
											This is the course where most people think is the only job of an analyst. Here I learn about the steps data analysts take to organize data & combine data from multiple sources.
											I also learned about spreadsheet calculations & pivot tables, SQL Calculations, temporary tables and data validation.

								<div class="contents"><br>
									<section>
										<h2>Share Data through the art of Visualization</h2>
										<p>
											Everyone enjoys a good story. Visualizations along with good data storytelling will help you communicate the meaning of a dataset to your audience. 
											Sharing the results of an analysis is actually one of the most important parts of an analyst’s job. Do you want the results of your analysis to just show up, or do you want the results to show off?
										</p>
										<p>
											In the share phase of data analytics I learned about design thinking, How data analysts use visualizations to communicate about data and The benefits of Tableau for presenting data analysis findings.
											The course also teaches you data-driven story telling, dashboards & dashboard filters and some strategies for creating an effective data presentation.

								<div class="contents"><br>
									<section>
										<h2>Data Analysis with R Programming</h2>
										<p>
											In this course I learned how to use the R programming language to work with my data without tool limitations. 
											I got plenty of practice using R for statistical analysis, and RStudio—an integrated developer environment (IDE) for R that I will use to create advanced data visualizations with lots of detail. 
											R makes it easier to present my data with beautiful, artistic style.
										</p>
										<p>
											Here I got to learn a new programming language, R. It was easier to learn with my previous knowledge of C and Python. Here I got to install and use RStudio and the cloud platform of R. 
											There was a lot of knowledge to take in, and the course provided a solid foundation on which to work with in my upcoming Case study.

										<h2>Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study</h2>
										<p>
											Approaching the last leg of my journey: the eighth and final course! I have gained the knowledge and job-ready skills to work as an entry-level data analyst. 
											Through video vignettes, readings, journal entries, hands-on activities, online discussions, and networking with other learners, I now know what it takes to analyze and process data.
										</p>
										<p>
											The final course provided three case studies, of which I chose to do the Bellabeat case study. The analysis can be found on my <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeanpierremulder/bellabeat-case-study-in-r" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> profile. I thoroughly
											enjoyed the challenge of going through the process of asking the right questions, preparing & processing the data, analyzing the data in accordance to the business task and
											finally sharing the visualizations and recommendations.

											Even though I have completed the course and it provided me with an excellent foundation, I am constantly improving and practicing.
											In the near future, more projects will be listed on my GitHub and Kaggle profiles.
											I am already going through the other case studies I did not do for my capstone, to include them and gain more knowledge.
